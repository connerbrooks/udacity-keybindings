## About
This userscript enables Vim and Emacs keybindings for Udacity's embedded 
[CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/) editor. No longer will your code be littered
with stray `i`s and `dd`s!

## Installation
Firefox: [click here](http://ecmendenhall.github.com/udacity-keybindings/udacity-extended-keybindings.user.js)
to install.

Chrome: [click here](http://ecmendenhall.github.com/udacity-keybindings/udacity-extended-keybindings.crx) 
to download the script, packaged as a Chrome extension. Open your extension settings 
(chrome://extensions/). Drag the `.crx` file over the window and drop to install.

This script is also available on [userscripts.org](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/156966).

## Using Extended Keybindings
Once the script is installed, you'll see a 'Keybindings' button next to the "Reset" and "Test Run"
buttons underneath the embedded code editor. Click to rotate through the included keyboard
configurations: default, Vim, and Emacs. When Vim normal mode is enabled, you'll see
a fat blue cursor. Most of your favorite Vim commands will now work. (Try `ci(` or `5dd`!)
To get a feel for what's available without messing up your own code, check out the 
[Vim](http://codemirror.net/demo/vim.html) and [Emacs](http://codemirror.net/demo/emacs.html)
demos from the CodeMirror site. I've only tested a few Emacs commands, but many of your
favorite inscrutable pinky contortions should be available too.
